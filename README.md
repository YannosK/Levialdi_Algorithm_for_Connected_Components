# A Study on Levialdi's ALgorithm for Connected Components

This was based on a project of an MSc course on Algorithms and Data Structures, by proffesor [D. Reisis](http://scholar.uoa.gr/dreisis/home)

The goal was to study Levialdi's paper (included in this repository) and write a report (also included in this repository - in Greek Language unfortunately). I tested the algorithm in a jupyter notebook, using joblib for concurrent execution
